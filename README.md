## Hi, I'm Abdullah


### About me

 - atm, I'm building a Discord Bot for my personal server
 - I'm also studying Computer Science at the University of Warwick.
 - Still trying to decide what kind of software engineering I like most. Should junior engineers even think about specialising this early on?
 - Actively seeking experience (you can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-ismail-olalere/)

### Projects
 - [Badeni](https://github.com/ismail-abdul/badeni) - a discord bot I use to share music with my friends. It's probably not legal but eh, who's it really hurting?
 - more soon !!!

### Interests

 - 🏀 Basketball (more playing, less watching) 
 - 🎬 Anime & Films (my favourite? Naruto by far) 
 - ✍🏿 Writing (about anime & films ofc) 
 - 👨🏿‍🍳 Cooking (cus I love eating 😋 )

### Is Leetcode really that important ???
